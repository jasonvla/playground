This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2.6 million customers and by analyzing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad-hoc modular networks. .},

Using content analysis, 1,114 fan comments on BTS’s YouTube videos were examined. Approximately two-thirds of analyzed comments displayed at least one of the four indicators of parasocial interaction explored: authenticity, affability, social attraction, and fandom. Furthermore, there was a significant difference between how parasocial interaction (PSI) indicators appeared in the music videos compared to the personality-driven nonmusic videos. The music videos had comments that displayed affability and fandom more frequently, while the personality-driven nonmusic videos displayed higher amounts of social attraction. Social attraction was also the most frequently displayed PSI indicator, implying that fans consuming content through YouTube are more likely to focus on the visual appeal of the content. This research fosters a deeper understanding of the nature of parasocial interaction between fans and celebrities in the context of online media.}

One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users’ typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

Through various contents, BTS has shown people their sincerity and cheerful side. People have familiarised themselves with BTS via such videos and thereby have come to perceive the group members as being the same kind of people as the viewers are. Of course, people have focused on different aspects of BTS. As shown in the topic modeling results, some have focused on the chemistry among the members, while others have concentrated on the appeal of their favourite members. However, regardless of their area of focus, people have shared a sense of togetherness with the group and have empathised with the lives of its members. Furthermore, they have been moved by the group’s dedication and growth, expressing support for its members’ hearts and thoughts. Also, network analysis results indicated that people have felt that BTS deserves their success based on the group’s teamwork, character, and performances.

  abstract = {As digital fandom communities expand and diversify, user engagement patterns increasingly shape the social and emotional fabric of online platforms. In the era of Industry 4.0, data-driven approaches are transforming how online communities understand and optimize user engagement. In this study, we examine how different forms of activity, specifically posting and commenting, characterize fandom engagement on Weverse, a global fan community platform. By applying a clustering approach to large-scale user data, we identify distinct subsets of heavy users, separating those who focus on creating posts (post-heavy users) from those who concentrate on leaving comments (comment-heavy users). A subsequent linguistic analysis using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool revealed that post-heavy users typically employ a structured, goal-oriented style with collective pronouns and formal tones, whereas comment-heavy users exhibit more spontaneous, emotionally rich expressions enhanced by personalized fandom-specific slang and extensive emoji use. Building on these findings, we propose design implications such as pinning community-driven content, offering contextual translations for fandom-specific slang, and introducing reaction matrices that address the unique needs of each group. Taken together, our results underscore the value of distinguishing multiple dimensions of engagement in digital fandoms, providing a foundation for more nuanced platform features that can enhance positive user experience, social cohesion, and sustained community growth.},

In this paper we present three studies that focus on YouTube music. We first show that music videos are the most popular content genre in YouTube. We then present a typology of traditional and user-generated music videos discovered in YouTube. It includes twelve subtypes of music videos under three main types: traditional, user-appropriated, and derivative. Last, we present findings on user engagement statistics that go beyond view, comment, and vote counts. These metrics show that while music videos gather more views, engagement differences with other content genres are miniscule. However, there are notable differences in engagement between different music video types. This is prominent between different artists on one hand, and between traditional and user-generated videos on the other. We synthesize these findings by discussing the importance of user-generated videos in YouTube’s music ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Many networks of interest in the sciences, including a variety of social and biological networks, are found to divide naturally into communities or modules. The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure has attracted considerable recent attention. One of the most sensitive detection methods is optimization of the quality function known as "modularity" over the possible divisions of a network, but direct application of this method using, for instance, simulated annealing is computationally costly. Here we show that the modularity can be reformulated in terms of the eigenvectors of a new characteristic matrix for the network, which we call the modularity matrix, and that this reformulation leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of better quality than competing methods in noticeably shorter running times. We demonstrate the algorithm with applications to several network data sets.},

Drawing upon a dataset of some 500 comments, I note the various strategies that fans, both Irish and non-Irish, adopt to engage in public displays of Irishness and explore the personal links that they make with Ireland and Irish culture to situate themselves as “authentic.” I demonstrate how, for Rory Gallagher fans, Irishness is an unstable, malleable concept that can simultaneously express regionalist, nationalist and transnationalist identity, yet it tends to be non-sectarian and rooted in a shared love for music rather than any political/religious differences. Moreover, it is essential in determining internal hierarchies and status within the fan group, with those asserting the most Irishness seen as most authentic. Overall, its findings contribute to an important growing body of work on Irish musicology and national identity.},

Developing suitable empirical approaches to render them accountable and to study their social power has become a prominent scholarly concern. This article proposes an approach to examine what an algorithm does, not only to move closer to understanding how it works, but also to investigate broader forms of agency involved. To do this, we examine YouTube’s search results ranking over time in the context of seven sociocultural issues. Through a combination of rank visualizations, computational change metrics and qualitative analysis, we study search ranking as the distributed accomplishment of ‘ranking cultures’. First, we identify three forms of ordering over time – stable, ‘newsy’ and mixed rank morphologies. Second, we observe that rankings cannot be easily linked back to popularity metrics, which highlights the role of platform features such as channel subscriptions in processes of visibility distribution. Third, we find that the contents appearing in the top 20 results are heavily influenced by both issue and platform vernaculars. YouTube-native content, which often thrives on controversy and dissent, systematically beats out mainstream actors in terms of exposure. We close by arguing that ranking cultures are embedded in the meshes of mutually constitutive agencies that frustrate our attempts at causal explanation and are better served by strategies of ‘descriptive assemblage’.},

This paper presents a social network analysis-based methodology for detecting commenter mobs on YouTube. These mobs of commenters collaborate to boost engagement on certain videos. The method provides a way to characterize channels based on the level of suspicious commenter behavior and detect coordination among channels. To evaluate our model, we analyzed 20 YouTube channels, 7,782 videos, 294,199 commenters, and 596,982 comments that propagated false views about the U.S. Military.
